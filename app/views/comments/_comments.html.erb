<!--
Comments Partial (for displaying)

1. controller should retrieve comments for an object (which controller? probably the parent controller)
2. controller should pass them to the view, which would pass them into the partial


3. need a separate form partial for creating and editing comments

since they're rendered on the same page, does it make sense to nest? 


pausing here to write some tests -->
