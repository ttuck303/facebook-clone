<!--
Comments Partial (for displaying)

1. controller should retrieve comments for an object (which controller? probably the parent controller)
2. controller should pass them to the view, which would pass them into the partial


3. need a separate form partial for creating and editing comments

since they're rendered on the same page, does it make sense to nest? 

actually, should be able to use the same form, with one using get and one using post, I believe
can't remember how to do that right now so I will get back to it



pausing here to write some tests -->

<% object.comments.all.each do |c| %>
  <%= c.body %> - <%= c.user.email %> at <%= c.updated_at %> Likes: <%= c.likes.count %> <%= render 'likes/like_link', object: c %> 
  <% if current_user == c.user %>
    <%= link_to "Delete", comment_path(c), method: :delete %> 
  <% end %><br>
<% end %>
